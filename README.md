#Sharp Theme 1.0
A simple, sharp, modern theme for MyBB.

##Features

- some customised templates
- iOS, favicon and Google Webfonts support

##Installation
- Upload all files to your MyBB forum.

##Notes
This theme has some customised templates to change some styling of specific pages. There may be instances where you don't want this styling or you may need to update templates with new MyBB versions. You can revert them, but it is recommend you back up the template and look for things to add back in later.

Sub-menu support is available through some tweaking of the CSS. I will try to make it easier to customise sub-menus in the future.
